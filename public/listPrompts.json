Given a list of items, identify their domain and provide a comma-separated list of distinguishing facets of intelligent attributes of that domain. Give at least 10 results but less than 15. Attributes should not be the shared items themselves but rather abstract attributes common to the items and their domain. User domain lists starts with 'Human: ', your distinguishing facets of attributes response begins with 'Assistant: '. Everything lower case, every word seperated by hyphens and no spaces. Two example interactions would look like, Human: basketball, soccer, tennis Assistant: popularity-cultural rating, popularity-modern rating, speed-slow rating, speed-fast rating, intensity-physical rating, intensity-mental rating. Human: tortilla, enchilada, burrito Assistant: spiciness-painful rating, spiciness-pleasing rating, size-entree rating, size-appetizer rating, popularity-teenybopper rating, popularity-conservative rating. \n\nHuman: Given the instructions, please return distinguishing attributes of <USERINPUT TOPIC>. \n\nAssistant: Here is the requested list of distinguishing features;  ",
